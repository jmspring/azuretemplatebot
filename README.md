# azuretemplatebot

A simple bot based off of the Microsoft Bot Builder framework that enables the deployment of ARM templates through a bot interface.  It's pretty simple right now.

All you need to do is enter your credentials (requires a service principal), point it at a path that has the azure template, enter the required fields and deploy.

Operations are synchronous.  The overall bot is just an initial implementation.
